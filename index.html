    <p>
    All representations were produced from the MASTER file with the following FFMPEG parameters:<br>
    — Framerate not defined (inherited from the uploaded source).<br>
    — Codec: libx264.<br>
    — Forced keyframes = 3 seconds (considering the further DASH segment duration).<br>
    — Bitrate (VBR) defined through CRF.<br>
    — <code>-sc_threshold 0</code> <span>was not</span> defined. (to keep "organic" keyframes based on scenes as-is. The segmenter's cutting with the defined time interval works perfectly with the forced keyframe interval).<br>
    BTW: I tried to pass all MP4Box operations with this "classical" flag, but it didn't help.<br>
